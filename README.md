## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- Git
- Beego

## Technologies Used

- [Go](https://golang.org/) - The main programming language
- [Beego v2](https://github.com/beego/beego) - Web framework for building the API
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) - External API for cat-related data
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Front-end css framework


## Key Features

- Fetch random cat images
- Retrieve comprehensive breed information
- Get breed-specific images
- Favorite cat images
- Vote on cat images
- Manage favorite cat images (add, list, delete)
- Configuration management using Beego's app.conf
- Testing 

## Installation

### 1. Install Go

If you haven't installed Go, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Go downloads page: https://golang.org/dl/
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions for your OS:
   - Windows: Run the MSI installer and follow the prompts.
   - macOS: Open the package file and follow the prompts.
   - Linux: Extract the archive to `/usr/local`:
     ```
     tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.x.x.linux-amd64.tar.gz
     ```
4. Add Go to your PATH:
   - For bash, add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
     ```
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
     export GOPATH=$HOME/go
     export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
     ```
   - For other shells, add the equivalent to your shell's configuration file.
5. Verify the installation by opening a new terminal and running:
      ```
      go version
      ```
6. create src to keep your  all beego app here
      ```
      mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/
      ```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine in the default Go path:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/ 
git clone https://github.com/Khairun-Nahar-Munne/cat-app.git
cd cat-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project uses Beego v2 and other dependencies. Install them using the following commands:

```
go get github.com/beego/beego/v2
go get github.com/astaxie/beego/logs
go mod tidy
```


## Configuration

### 1. API Key

This project requires an API key from The Cat API. To obtain one:

1. Visit https://thecatapi.com/
2. Sign up for an account
3. Generate an API key from your dashboard
4. There is already API Key of mine. You can use it
### 2. Configuration File

Create a `conf/app.conf` file in the project root with the following content:

```ini
appname = cat-app
httpport = 8080
runmode = dev
cat_api_url = "https://api.thecatapi.com/v1"
api_key = "live_i5ikdgttExQhChEMpt7UuGateqcwS8IVYlMGGBwSO3Mp7CatoYAhl9VAUgZ76Pqa"
```

Yopu can replace `api_key` with the API key you obtained from The Cat API.

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command from the project root directory:

```
bee run
```

If you don't have `bee` installed, you can install it with:

```
go get github.com/beego/bee/v2
```


The server will start, and you should see output indicating that it's running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running the Test

Run the test
```
go test -v ./tests 
```
Get Coverage
```
Step 1: go test -coverprofile coverage.out ./...
Step 2: go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total: | awk '{print $3}'
```
If you want to see coverage of each file in html
```
go tool cover -html coverage.out    
```

## API Endpoints

The project provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/cat/fetch`: Fetch a random cat image
- `GET /api/breeds`: Get a list of all cat breeds
- `GET /api/breed/:id`: Get specific breeds
- `POST /api/favorites`: Add a cat image to favorites
- `POST /api/votes`: Vote on a cat image
- `GET /api/votes`: Get latest votes
- `GET /api/get_favorites`: Get a list of favorite cat images
- `DELETE /api/favourite/:id`: Delete a favorite cat image


## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Beego directory structure:

```
